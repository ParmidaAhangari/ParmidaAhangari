## 👋 Hi there, I'm Parmida!

🎓 I'm a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Guilan, passionate about software development and eager to learn new technologies every day.

💻 I mostly work with **Python**, **Java**, and have recently started exploring **Django**. I enjoy building practical tools—like my recent Telegram bot that converts speech to text in Persian and English.

🧠 I'm also diving into **Lexical Analysis** projects using **JFlex/Flex**, and experimenting with organizing files (photos & videos) through smart Python scripts.

🐳 I'm learning **Docker** to deploy bots and services that stay up even when my PC is off. My goal is to master backend deployment and cloud technologies.

🎸 Outside of coding, I play guitar and love music. I'm also interested in design—currently learning **Figma** to create beautiful UIs.

📌 Based in Iran, and looking forward to new opportunities worldwide—whether it's contributing to open-source, collaborating on interesting projects, or working abroad someday.
